# Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and training a logistic regression classifier. The final model is evaluated on a validation set, and predictions are prepared for submission to a Kaggle competition.
